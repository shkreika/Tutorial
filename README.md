# Tutorial Repository

# Introduction: 
# My name is Tina and I am an automation enthusiast who has been part of the Operations Industry for more than 6 years (as of writing)
# My experience as one of the pioneers of a start-up company has helped equip me with skills that I, hopefully, would help everyone who has stumbled towards this repository.
# I love creating new ways to make processes faster and systematizing it
# I will be putting everything that I have learned along the way here and will be divided into "/" depending on its function
# I will slowly create tiktok videos to complement the tutorials here

# Apps and tools tutorial for automating processes in operations
# Feel free to edit, copy, and improve all files in this repository

# Cheers!
