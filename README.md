# Tutorial Repository

## Introduction: 
My name is Tina and I am an automation enthusiast who has been part of the Operations Industry for more than 6 years (as of writing). My experience as one of the pioneers of a start-up company has helped equip me with skills that I, hopefully, would help everyone who has stumbled towards this repository.
I love creating new ways to make processes faster and systematizing it. I will be putting everything that I have learned along the way here and will be divided into "/" depending on its function. _I will slowly create tiktok videos to complement the tutorials here._
